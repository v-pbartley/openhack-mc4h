# Challenge-00 - Welcome!

## Introduction 
In this preliminary challenge, you will be checking your Azure Subscription and other pieces of your environment to make sure that all prerequisites are met before deploying the Azure components used in this hack. Please make certain that everything is in place before proceeding to Challenge-01.

## Background 
The MC4H OpenHack presents a series of challenges to help learners build skills in deploying and configuring [Azure API for FHIR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/azure-api-for-fhir/overview), [FHIR-Proxy](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-proxy), and supporting tools. After completing the MC4H OpenHack, learners will be able to build the system architectures featured on __[Microsoft Health Architectures](https://microsoft.github.io/health-architectures/)__.
 
## Learning Objectives for Challenge-00
+ Understand the learner goals of the MC4H OpenHack
+ Understand the prerequisites for the MC4H OpenHack
+ Check environment to make sure that all prerequisites are met

## What are the general learner goals of the MC4H OpenHack?
In general, we want learners to walk away from this hack with a sense of confidence in deploying, configuring, and implementing Microsoft health data solutions.

+ In doing this hack, learners will know how to **ingest**, **transform**, and **connect health data** using the Microsoft Azure health data platform.

+ The tasks in this hack require learners to locate information in technical documentation and **resolve issues independently**. This will help learners develop autonomy in resolving issues.

+ The challenges will leave learners with a strong concept of how the components fit together. With this knowledge, learners will be ready to **apply Microsoft Health & Life Sciences (HLS) tools in real-world production environments**.  

## Prerequisite Knowledge for the MC4H OpenHack

+ A solid foundation in **Azure fundamentals**. If you are new to Microsoft Azure, please visit [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-cloud-concepts/) to learn more about the platform.

+ Familiarity with health data interoperability and the **FHIR R4 data standard**. Please visit [here](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/) for more information about the FHIR R4 specification.

+ Experience with making **REST API calls** using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-testing/) or a similar API testing utility.

## Environment Prerequisites
Please be sure to have the following ready in your environment before proceeding to Challenge-01.

+ Azure Subscription with [Contributor/Co-Owner rights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles)
+ [Application Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#all-roles) role in your [Azure Active Directory (AAD) tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis#:~:text=Azure%20tenant,tenant%20represents%20a%20single%20organization.)
+ GitHub account ([link](https://github.com/))
+ Postman installed - either desktop or web client app ([link](https://www.postman.com/))

__Note:__ Free Postman cloud accounts require a login via email or a Google account. Additionally, Postman recommends that if you choose to use the web client, you should also download the desktop application. You can read more and download the desktop client [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/?utm_source=postman-home).
