# Challenge 0 - Welcome!

## Introduction 
Welcome to the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare (MC4H) OpenHack! In this preliminary challenge, you will be checking your Azure environment and other components to make sure that you can deploy the featured MC4H tools. Please make certain that everything is in place before proceeding to the next challenge.

## Backgound 
The MC4H OpenHack will help users gain skills in deploying Azure API for FHIR, FHIR-Proxy, Dynamics/Dataverse MC4H solutions, and supporting tools. After completing the MC4H OpenHack, users will have the know-how to build system architectures highlighted on __[Microsoft Health Architectures](https://microsoft.github.io/health-architectures/)__.
 
## Learning Objectives for Challenge-0
+ Understand the prerequisites for the MC4H OpenHack
+ Familiarize yourself with MC4H tools and architectures

## Prerequisite knowledge

+ Participants in the MC4H OpenHack are expected to have a solid foundation in Azure fundamentals. If you are new to Microsoft Azure, visit [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-cloud-concepts/) to learn about the platform.

+ Since this OpenHack is intended for healthcare IT professionals, we assume learners have a basic familiarity with general topics related to health data interoperability. In particular, learners are expected to have a working knowledge of the FHIR R4 data standard. Please visit [here](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/) for more information about the FHIR R4 specification.

+ In Challenges 05-08, we cover MC4H architectures that incorporate Microsoft Dynamics/Dataverse healthcare industry solutions. Because most participants do not have access to a Dynamics/Dataverse environment, Challenges 05-08 are presented as instructor-lead training modules. A basic knowledge of the Dynamics/Dataverse landscape will be helpful to get the most out of this portion of the training. Please visit [here](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/en-us/dataverse/) to learn more about the Dynamics/Dataverse platform.

## Environment Prerequisites
Please be sure to have the following components ready in your environment before beginning the MC4H OpenHack.
