## Export and Anonymize Data

Organizations that gather and use PHI are required to protect patient privacy. HIPAA allows entites to use PHI for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations. For other uses such as research, additional rules apply to protect patient data. In many cases the dataset must be anonymized. HIPAA provides a list of 18 identifies that much be removed to consider the dataset de-identified. These 18 identifiers are known as the safe harbor method of de-identification. The Azure API for Fhir support exporting data and removing identifiers to create HIPAA compliant de-identified datasets.

## Challenge 
Challenge 9 will give you an opportunity to practice evaluating de-identification needs and exporting anonymized datasets from the Fhir server. Challenge is located **[here](https://github.com/microsoft/openhack-mc4h/tree/main/Challenge-9)**.
