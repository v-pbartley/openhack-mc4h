## Healthcare Analytics
Healthcare data has the potential to drive insights that can improve patient care, lower healthcare costs, improve patient experiences, and so much more. Patterns in healthcare data can provide better insight into a patient's condition or how best to target care for a specific patient population. As data analytics tools rapidly advance, backed by scalable compute in the cloud, the scope and impact of healthcare data grows with it.
