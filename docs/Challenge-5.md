## Sync Agent 
The goal of the FHIR-SyncAgent is to sychronize health data between Azure API for FHIR and Dataverse' Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare securely and seemlessly. Applications built on the Dynamics platform (which includes Dynamics Model applications) or makes use of Dataverse can operate without needing to make REST API calls directly to Azure API for FHIR. In addition to running Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare solutions, developers can also take advantage of the Dynamics' low-code/no-code environment to construct solutions/applications that can read & write healthcare related data to the Azure API for FHIR.
